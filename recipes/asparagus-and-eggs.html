    <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic Clove</li>
        <li>thin-stemmed asparagus stalks</li>
        <li>large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>a pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.</li>
